.. note:: Users have an additional “Screen” delivery mechanism for both their alerts and notifications. The endpoint for Screen notifications is the Enstratius console - that is to say, alerts and notifications with the Screen preference ticked will be delivered to the footer of the Enstratius console and the Console > Alerts page. See Screen Notifications below for more information.

In the following example, any event on any resource (ANY.ANY) will trigger a Screen notification. FIREWALL.CREATE will trigger an Email notification, SERVER.CREATE will trigger a Topic notification, and FIREWALL.UPDATE, FIREWALL.DELETE, and SERVER.DELETE will trigger SMS notifications.
