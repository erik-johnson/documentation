The **Name** field is where you specify a custom domain name for your distribution. (e.g.
example.cloudfront.net)

The **Aliases** field allows you to map comma delimited aliases to the specific domain name.

The **Select A Directory** drop-down contains a list of all root-level directories located on
the Platform > Files page of the Enstratius console. The directory that is selected for the
distribution is mapped to the domain name you created.

Other Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the actions tab next to your newly created distribution will provide you with the
options to edit, delete, or activate/deactivate the distribution.
