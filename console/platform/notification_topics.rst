Enstratius supports management of cloud based notification topic web services through the
Enstratius console. Notification topics are often applied to an application and can be used
to automatically send messages to subscribers or other applications.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Enstratius currently supports the creation and management of Amazon Simple Notification
Service (Amazon SNS). See `Amazon SNS <http://aws.amazon.com/sns>`_ for more information and current pricing.


Notification topics make it easy for developers to send out important messages to
applications or users. This allows developers to effectively communicate
time-sensitive information in the form of a message.
