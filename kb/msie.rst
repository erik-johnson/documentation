MSIE

Enstratius supports the latest 2 versions of MSIE. At the time of this writing, this means
MSIE >= 8.

Here is some guidance for users accessing Enstratius with Microsoft Internet Explorer.

If your browser is >= MSIE 8, but operating in MSIE 7 document mode, this will result in a
degraded browser experience when operating the Enstratius cloud management platform.

To check your browser's document mode, open Developer Tools. In IE8, go to the Tools menu
and select Developer Tools (or hit F12)

   MSIE 9 Developer Tools

At the top right of the Developer Tools window, you will see the Browser Mode and the
Document Mode. Please ensure the Document Mode is set to the highest possible version of
the browser.
