   Example Architecture

enStratus has a very flexible deployment model. In a high-availability environment,
enStratus can be deployed on a very scalable and resilient architecture.
The high-availability architecture is suitable for production deployments of enStratus.

enStratus software can also be deployed on a single server or in a two-node configuration
for the purposes of a proof-of-concept environment.
