Architecture
============

Enstratius has a very flexible deployment model. In a high-availability environment,
Enstratius can be deployed on a very scalable and resilient architecture.  The
high-availability architecture is suitable for production deployments of Enstratius.

The DMCM platform can also be deployed on a single server for development, proof of concept or lab environments.
For production environments, there are two :ref:`supported configurations <supported_configuration>` (:ref:`visual representation <ha_architecture>`).
