On-Premise
==========

On-Premise installations of DMCM make sense for many reasons, and, due to the
flexibility of the DMCM architecture, you can deploy Enstratius as a single-node
personal development environment, single node POC, or a fully scaled high-availability cloud
management solution.

Setting up a development DMCM environment or a single-node DMCM environment for
sales/demonstration purposes just got a whole lot simpler. By leveraging vagrant, you can
install the full Enstratius cloud management software stack in less than 15 minutes,
depending on your network speed.


POC

Installing DMCM cloud management software as part of a POC can be done by leveraging
a configuration management engine like Chef from Opscode.

POC installations are always performed on a single node.

Production
----------

DMCM can also be deployed in a High-Availability production architecture to support
hundreds of users and cloud accounts. There are two supported architectures for production installations:

- 9 nodes
- 23 node HA
