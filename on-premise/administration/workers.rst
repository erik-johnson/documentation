   Monitors/Workers Service Connections

Worker Overview
----------------

The enStratus worker service consists of two components, a publisher and a subscriber. At a very high level,
these components:

1. Publisher

  - The publisher is responsible for pushing actions onto a queue. 

2. Subscriber

  - The subscriber is responsible for taking actions off of the queue and acting accordingly.

Starting Worker
---------------

To start the worker service:

.. code-block:: bash

	/etc/init.d/enstratus-workers start

Worker Start Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The worker init script performs the following actions:

#. Executes /services/worker/bin/publisher, passing it the argument: start. This starts the publisher process.
#. Executes /services/worker/bin/subscriber, passing it the argument: start. This starts the subscriber process.

Stopping Worker
---------------

To stop the worker service:

.. code-block:: bash

	/etc/init.d/enstratus-workers stop

Configuration Files
-------------------

The enStratus workers service has 9 configuration files

.. hlist::
   :columns: 3

   * dasein-persistence.properties
   * enstratus-km-client.cfg
   * enstratus-provisioning.cfg
   * worker.properties
   * mq.cfg
   * pinger
   * worker
   * publisher
   * subscriber

worker
~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/bin/worker

The worker file controls the start of a new worker process. 

pinger
~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/bin/pinger

The pinger file start the pinger process associated with the workers service. This is
identical to the pinger process being run with the dispatcher and monitor services. It is
acceptable to run multiple pinger services.

publisher
~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/bin/publisher

The publisher file controls the enStratus publisher process.

subscriber
~~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/bin/subscriber

The subscriber file controls the enStratus subscriber process.

enstratus-km-client.cfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/classes/enstratus-km-client.cfg

This file controls the connection to the KM service by the workers. 

enstratus-provisioning.cfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/classes/enstratus-provisioning.cfg

This file is a general control point for several items, the most important of which is the
encryption key for encrypting connections to the KM service. This is also where a setting
called SOURCE_CIDR is made, which specifies IP addresses from which enStratus will make
connections to guest VM.

dasein-persistence.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/classes/dasein-persistence.properties

This file defines the connection to the dasein persistence layer of enStratus. It also
specifies the connection point to the Riak database service.

mq.cfg
~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/classes/mq.cfg

This file controls how the monitor service connects to the mq service.

worker.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Path:

  /services/worker/classes/worker.properties

This file is used to define the connection points for the worker processes
to connect to the provisioning and analytics MySQL databases.
