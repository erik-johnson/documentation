About
=====

This site is built using the `Sphinx Documentation Engine <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ 

The contents of the site are hosted in a publicly available github repository:

``git@github.com:enStratus/documentation.git``

You are welcome to clone the contents and build your own local copy.

Local Build (HTML)
------------------

After cloning the repository, you can build the site locally using these steps:

#. Download the sphinx utility:

   * http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
   * Install python setup tools ( sudo port install py-setuptools )
   * sudo easy_install -U Sphinx

#. cd documentation/

#. make clean

#. make html

#. open ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser

Sample Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   rm -rf _build/*

   Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html.

Local Build (LaTeX)
-------------------

.. note:: While the LaTeX build will succeed, the formatting for the content is not yet
   optimized for PDF. This will be done incrementally as the site content is standardized.

You will need to have a LaTeX engine such as MacTeX installed to use the Sphinx LaTeX
feature.

The site can also be compiled into a PDF document using LaTeX. To build the PDF, follow
the same steps as above except:

#. make clean

#. make latexpdf

Sample Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

   rm -rf _build/*
   sphinx-build -b latex -d _build/doctrees   . _build/latex
