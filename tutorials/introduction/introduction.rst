Introduction
============

Welcome to the Enstratius tutorials page. The goal of this section is to bring to life the
power of Enstratius as a cloud management, automation, and orchestration platform by
providing clear instructions on "how to do stuff". 

First, get started by running through the QuickStart guide. Then procede to the Wordpress Tutorial.

During demonstrations and client visits, we often present an automation demonstration
using the Wordpress content management system.

Wordpress is sufficiently complex to demonstrate the full suite of Enstratius automation
capabilities, including the orchestration of a two dependent tiers of scalable servers.

LAMP application stacks are simple to deploy and scale, and Enstratius gives you the
framework to scale and provide for very high-availability applications.

Please follow the Wordpress tutorial at left, you'll be scaling in no time.
