Checking the status of discovery
=================================
Once you've registered your account with enStratus, a background thread will undertake the task of enumerating the following information from your Chef server:

* environments
* roles
* cookbooks (and recipes)

Currently there is no visible progress on this action for the user. To check the progress of discovery, do the following:

* Navigate to "Configuration Managemet" -> "Components"

.. figure:: ./images/cm-menu-components.png
   :alt: Configuration Management Menu
   :align: center

* Select your Chef server from the drop-down titled "Select Configuration Management Account"

.. figure:: ./images/cm-components-account-menu.png
   :alt: Components Account Menu
   :align: center

The page will redraw and display a list of any ``roles`` and ``cookbooks`` discovered along with the date and time of discovery

.. figure:: ./images/cm-components-page.png

   :align: center

A word on asynchrous discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   Because discovery is asynchronous, you might not see all the data you expect to see.
   As the page says, changes on the Chef server may not be immediately reflected.
   Currently there is no way to force a refresh of the discovery process.

Note that the asynchronous nature ONLY affects the ability of enStratus to know what objects are available for assignment when launching a server.
enStratus does not store copies of the actual cookbooks. If you make a change to an existing cookbook or recipe that enStratus has discovered, it is not neccessary that
enStratus have discovered this change unless you are adding a new recipe that it has yet to discover.

This will become clearer when you launch a server the first time.

.. tip::
   When making frequent changes to your Chef cookbooks, it can be difficult to test those especially when creating new roles and they have yet to be discovered by enStratus (and thus are not visible in the ``Launch`` dialog for new instances). To work around this limitation, you can create a few empty test roles with no run_list in them before registering the account with enStratus. Now you can change the run_list of those roles at will on the Chef server without enStratus needing to know anything more than they exist.
