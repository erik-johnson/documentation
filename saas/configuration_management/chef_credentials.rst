.. _saas_chef_credentials:

Generating credentials
----------------------

Before adding your Chef server to the enStratus console, you'll need to bits of information. This differs based on if you are running OSC vs. OHC/OPC.
Regardless of which type of Chef server product you are using, enstratus will need to be able to communicate with the Chef server API endpoint.
Additionally, enStratus will need an API client account and that account's PEM file. This single set of credentials will be used for the following tasks:

* Making API calls to the Chef server to read ``roles``, ``environments`` and ``cookbooks``.
* Bootstrapping new nodes via ``chef-client``
* Optionally, deleting node and client records after server termination

.. warning:: enStratus will NEVER alter any records on your Chef server. The logic simply
   doesn't exist in enStratus.  enStratus' access is read-only and only to the objects listed
   above. Please see the note below regarding ``admin`` access, however, if you'd like
   enStratus to take care of a few common termination-related tasks for you.

OSC
~~~

For OSC, you can either provide the existing validation credentials you currently use or
generate new credentials specifically for enStratus to use.  To generate custom
credentials for enStratus in OSC, you can use ``knife``:

``knife client create enstratus-validator -d -a``

Make note of the client name and also the private key returned to you.

.. note:: Note that we passed the ``-a`` option. This makes the enstratus account an
   administrator. This is optional but **HIGHLY** recommended.  If enStratus has permissions,
   it will clean up any node and client records for instances enStratus created. This is very
   valuable in cases where you are relying on search in your recipes as part of an enStratus
   deployment.  

   **Not only will enStratus never create any client or node records on its own
   but it will also NEVER delete any client or node records for anything OTHER than instances
   created from within enStratus**

OHC/OPC
~~~~~~~

For OHC/OPC, the finer grained ACL system doesn't allow you to create clients that have
the same permissions as OSC clients by default. For this you will have to do one of the
following

* Provide enStratus with the original validation cert and user-name or
* create a custom client as described above and then grant it the appropriate permissions

For creating a custom client, after creating the client with knife, log into the OPC/OHC
web UI and do the following:

* Create a group that you can easily identify as belonging to enStratus.
* Add the client previously created to this new group
* Add the new group to the ``admins`` group

As a side effect of these steps, your new client will now have the permissions it needs to
"clean up" any instances created by enStratus. This applies ONLY to instances created from
within enStratus. If you wish to grant the same permissions to your existing validation
client, simply follow the same steps for creating a custom group and adding it to the
``admins`` group.
