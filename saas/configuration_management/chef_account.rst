Adding to enStratus
-------------------

Once you've created an account for enStratus to use and have the credentials, you can add
that to the enStratus console:

* Navigate to "Configuration Management" -> "Accounts"

* Click the link on the right side to "Add A New Configuration Management Account"

   :alt: Configuration Management Menu
   :align: center

* Select "Chef" from the "Configuration Management System" drop-down menu
* Fill in the fields as described.
	Note that specifically to enStratus, the following fields are required:
   
	* Budget Codes
	* Name
	* Description

At this point, enStratus will now begin discovery of your ``roles``, ``cookbooks`` and
``environments``.
