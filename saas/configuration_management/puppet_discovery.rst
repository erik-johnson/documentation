Checking the status of discovery
--------------------------------

Once you've registered your account with enStratus, a background thread will undertake the
task of enumerating the following information from your Puppet server:

* groups
* classes

Currently there is no visible progress on this action for the user. To check the progress
of discovery, do the following:

* Navigate to "Configuration Management" -> "Components"

.. figure:: ./images/cm-menu-components.png
   :alt: Configuration Management Menu
   :align: center

* Select your Puppet server from the drop-down titled "Select Configuration Management
  Account"

.. figure:: ./images/cm-components-account-menu-puppet.png
   :alt: Components Account Menu
   :align: center

The page will redraw and display a list of any ``groups`` and ``classes`` discovered along
with the date and time of discovery

.. figure:: ./images/puppet-cm-components-page.png
   :height: 900 px
   :width: 1400 px
   :alt: Discovery
   :align: center

Asynchronous Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Because discovery is asynchronous, you might not immediately see all the data
   you expect to see.  As the page says, changes on the Puppet server may not be immediately
   reflected.  Currently there is no way to force a refresh of the discovery process.

Note that the asynchronous nature ONLY affects the ability of enStratus to know what
objects are available for assignment when launching a server.  enStratus does not store
copies of the actual modules. If you make a change to an existing module that enStratus
has discovered, it is not necessary that enStratus have discovered this change unless you
are adding a new module that it has yet to discover.

This will become clearer when you launch a server the first time.

.. tip:: When making frequent changes to your modules, it can be difficult to test those
   especially when creating new groups and they have yet to be discovered by enStratus (and
   thus are not visible in the ``Launch`` dialog for new instances). To work around this
   limitation, you can create a few empty test groups with no classes or parameters in them
   before registering the account with enStratus. Now you can change the contents of those
   groups at will on the dashboard without enStratus needing to know anything more than they
   exist.
